# Introduction
Flammable gas can be used to cook and generate electricity.
The type of gas provided to home stoves/ovens/boilers is called liquified petroleum gas (LPG).
LPG is commonly supplied as propane ($$\ce{C3H8}$$) or butane ($$\ce{C4H10}$$), both of which are extremely flammable.

An alternative flammable gas, which can be generated at home, is methane ($$\ce{CH4}$$).
Methane is the main component of biogas, which can be produced when organic material decomposes in the presence of methanogenic bacteria.

### Biogas
Biogas is produced by the anaerobic decomposition of organic material.
The equation for this decomposition is;

Organic Waste $$\ce{->[methanogenic bacteria][35C]}$$ Biogas $$+$$ Digestate

Each of the products of the reaction contain different elements and compounds.
Biogas itself is composed of approximately 60% methane, 39% carbon dioxide, and 1% hydrogen sulphide {% cite calbry2022biogas %}.
The digestate produced is rich in nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous (which you'll recognise as key ingredients in fertilizer), and other minerals not emitted as gas by the bacteria (or unused at all).
Although this reaction can happen on solid organic waste, it is most time efficient when done in solution.

#### Biogas Reactor
A **biogas reactor** is a structure which converts waste organic material into biogas via anaerobic digestion (see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvQAg838xGs) for an excellent introduction).
Such reactors contain **methanogenic bacteria** which break down organic material, releasing carbon dioxide and methane.

The amount of waste which can be effectively digested by a biogas reactor is a function of its internal volume and the desired **hydraulic retention time** (HRT).
HRT is just a fancy way of saying how long the waste should spend inside the reactor on average.

The optimal HRT before diminishing returns is 25-30 days.

HRT = digester volume / feeding rate (L/day)

feeding rate = digester volume / 25

Using this formula, a 1000L digester could process up to 40L of organic waste per day.
Overfeeding can lead to higher hydrolysis/acidogenisis bacterial activity, which eventually leads to irreversible acidification.

5-10% total solids should be the aim to avoid plugging pipes or crusting.
This equals a maximum of 100g per L of feed.

optimal conditions are 35C operating temperature with an HRT of 25 days

Rather than just dumping kitchen waste and other organic material directly into the reactor, the feed can be enriched/enhanced in several ways.
The main pre-treatments to the feed are;

 - mechanical grinding - grinding down the waste into a paste, which will become a slurry when water is added, helps increase the rate of digestion and therefore the rate of biogas production
 - add plant biomas - plant leaves and non-woody matererial can be added

Plant biomass is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin {% cite gupta2012re %}.
Cellulose and hemicelluloses can be easily digested in comparison to lignin.



Methanogenisis is most efficient at pH 7.0, with a pH lower than 6.5 and below greatly reducing bacterial activity.




#### Biogas Generator
A **biogas generator** is a device which can convert biogas into electricity.
These generators can be expensive, but their output wattage can be very high (3500W+) using a large amount of biogas as input.
For example, a 2013 study {% cite de2013electric %} reported electricity generation of 0.68m$$^3$$ per kWh with an efficiency of 22.2%.
