## Electricity

### Basic Circuitry
The ampere (amp) is the unit of measure for electrical current (the speed at which electrons flow through a conductor).
Volts are the unit of measurement for the difference in electrical potential between any two points in an electrical circuit.
Ohms are the unit of measurement for eletrical resistance.

$$V = I * R$$

Watt is the unit of measurement for the rate at which eletrical energy is transferred in a circuit.

$$P = V * I$$

### Solar Panels
Solar panels generate electricity from sunlight.


### Batteries
