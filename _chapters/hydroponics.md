# Hydroponic Basics

Hydroponics is the growth of plants without soil. To achieve this, the soil’s role is replaced by a) an inert **growth medium**, and b) **nutrients** delivered in solution.
These components each support plant growth in different ways. Growth mediums provide physical support to the plant, and the nutrient solution provides essential chemical compounds in addition to water.

## Growth Mediums
In hydroponics, a growth medium, or substrate, is an inert substance which provides physical support to a growing plant.
Whilst these mediums are not strictly necessary, without them a set of supporting ropes/frames would be needed for each plant, so using them reduces the amount of labor/attention needed.

Growth mediums may also not be completely inert. 
Some mediums can absorb nutrients, which is expressed as their cation exchange capacity (**CEC**). 
Mediums with high CEC's are generally better as more nutrients can reach the plants where they directly contact the medium, but this can cause the medium itself to degrade.
Several popular growth mediums exist, each with their own benefits and drawbacks.

Water holding capacity (WHC)? 

Air filled porosity (AFP)

**Lava Rocks**

Lava rocks can be heated which causes them to dramatically expand. 
This produces a strong and lightweight material which can be used as a growth medium.
Examples of lava rock devired growth mediums are perlite and vermiculite.
Both of these mediums are lightweight, cheap, and moderately porous.
They can also both be dangerous if not handled carefully, as their dust contains silicon dioxide.
If inhaled, this can cause physical damage and scarrification of your lungs (a condition called silicosis {% cite leung2012silicosis %}), which permanently lowers your lung capacity and is untreatable.

### Coco Coir
The fibrous material which forms the shell of a coconut can be processed and used as a growth medium.
This material, known as coco coir, is lightweight, organic, renewable, and has a high capacity for absorbing nutrients.
This material can however naturally contain salt, which can affect the balance of the nutrient solution being used.

### Expanded Clay
Clay can be rolled into pebbles and cooked, which results in the creation of expanded clay pebbles.
These pebbles are a less dangerous, but more expensive, version of the lava rocks described above.
This considered, they can be beneficial given their size compared to other mediums, as larger gaps allow more oxygen in the air to reach parts of the roots.
However, they can also increase the PH of the nutrient solution.

### Peat Moss
A final growth medium for consideration is called peat moss.
It is gathered from naturally occurring (and finite) peat bogs, and is more expensive than other growth mediums.
It's benefit is that it doesn't leech nutrients from the nutrient solution it's used with, however as any organic material it will decay over time.

### Blends
Any pair, or group of the growth mediums mentioned above can be combined to form a composite growth medium. 
This can bring the benefits of one while reducing the drawbacks from another.
The sky is the limit when concocting composite mediums, and some plants may grow better in different mixes (for example, tall, heavy plants like corn may do better in a heavier medium like peat moss than in perlite).

### Special Mentions
Glass beads are not a suitable growth medium because the growth medium also acts to block light from reaching the roots. 
The roots themselves can function in light, but so can algae which may compete with the plants for nutrients. 
Therefore, opaque growth mediums are preferred - not because they’re better for the plant, but because they’re worse for the algae.
Additionally, large glass beads are much heavier than other mediums, which make it harder for younger/weaker plants to grow roots.

## Nutrient Solutions
In the absense of soil, the nutrients which plants need must be delivered somehow.
One way to achieve this is through a solution provided directly to the roots of the plants.
This nutrient solution must provide everything the plant needs other than the oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen it can access in the air.

Nitrogen, Phosforus, and Potassium (NPK), are the three ‘main ingredients’ for plant growth.

### Preventing Algae Bloom

#### Hydrogen Peroxide

#### Beneficial Bacteria
In order to avoid algae growth and other unwanted consumers of the nutrient solution, beneficial bacteria can be added.
These bacteria will out-compete any other organisms (other than the plants) which exist in the solution, which decreases the need for maintenance in the form of solution cleaning.


### 1:250 Stock Solution
This solution is described as a good general purpose hydroponic nutrient mix for a range of plants.

\item Create solution A
\item to 100ml of warm water, add 15ml of NPK fertilizer
\item add 7.5ml of magnesium sulphate to the water

\item Create solution B
\item to a new 100ml of warm water, add 15ml of calcium nitrate
\item add 4ml of A for each 1L of final solution

\item Create nutrient solution
\item add 4ml of B for each 1L of final solution



Total dissolved salts (TDS) meter measures electrical conductivity (EC). The 1:250 stock solution provides a 1900 us/cm (800ppm).

### Irrigation Cycles
While not essential, in some hydroponic configurations (e.g. Bato buckets), not providing a constinuous stream of nutrients to the plants can be beneficial.
Low irrigation can cause a build-up of salts which can damage the roots, but over-irrigation can prevent oxygen from being absorbed by the roots (depending on configuration).
- pauses in irrigation cause runoff
- runoff = roots exposed to oxygen (= good if not exposed already)
less absorbant growth  mediums = longer/more frequent irrigation cycles
more absorbant growth mediums = shorter/les frequent irrigation cycles

## Lighting
Most plants which use light to produce sugar using CO2, this process is called photosynthesis. However, not all light sources can be used for photosynthesis.

In this lab, we won’t be using any natural light from the sun, so the question is; which lights can be used instead?

To understand which lights we need, we need to know exactly how plants use light to produce sugar. 
This process begins with a 

Plants need red and blue wavelengths of visible light to grow. 

Inverse square law, luminosity decreases with the inverse square of the distance to the source.
1m away = 1m2, 2m away = 4m2, 3m away = 9m2
100W light 2m away is just 25W/m2
This only applies to distance, not bleeding off the edges.
You can reduce bleeding by adding mirrors, but you can't reduce the inverse square law.

# Hydroponic Techniques
There are several configurations, or techniques, which you can use to grow plants in the absense of soil.
These techniques broadly fall into two categories; **circulating** and **non-circulating**.
Circulating techniques employ the use of pumps or gravitationally advantagous structures which produce pressurised nutrient solution pipes.
These pipes can then be routed via containers/chanels/devices which are accessible to the plants.
Non-circulating techniques do not require the flow of nutrient solution from one location to another.
These techniques are typically lower maintenance, given the lack of any movement, but have finite growth potential given the fixed amount of nutrient solution available to each plant.
Of course, non-circulating configurations can be topped-up with nutrient solution, but at that stage you just have a circulating configuration with extra steps.

## Kratky Method
The Kraty method {% cite kratky2008three %} is a non-circulating technique, and involves setting a seedling plant in a perforated cup which is suspended above a closed tank of nutrient solution.
As the plant grows, its roots reach down into the nutrient solution, absorbing and utilising the nutrients as required.

## Dutch Buckets
Bato buckets, also known as Dutch buckets, are a hydroponic technique whereby nutrient solution is fed into one or more containers connected to the same irrigation and drainage lines.
This technique is very water and nutrient efficient as each plant has access to all of the nutrients in the system, and brings the benefit of circulating techniques that there is no practical limit to the amount of nutrients a plant can access given its root development.

## Nutrient Film Technique (NFT)
This technique involves passing a shallow stream of nutrient solution past the bare roots of plants.
The plants themselves can be suspended in a growth medium, or held in place by some other structure.
The key feature of structures which use this technique is direct root contact with a moving body of nutrient solution, rather than the nutrient being absorbed via a growth medium.
As with Dutch Buckets, NFTs provide essentially unlimited nutrients to each plant, which means growth is restricted by other factors such as support structure, disease, parasites, etc.

## Growth Chamber
Target and tolerance values allow strict control over parameters.
Hermetically sealed (airtight) chambers allow total control over air contents and flow.
