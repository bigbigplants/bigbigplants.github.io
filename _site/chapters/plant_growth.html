<p>Plants, like all living creatures, require nutrients and a suitable environment to grow. This growth follows a lifecycle which can be described in distinct stages. These stages are as follows;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sprout â€“ seeds germinate and grow their first pair of leaves using the nutrients in the seed itself</li>
  <li>Seedling â€“ roots begin to develop</li>
  <li>Vegetative â€“ stems and foliage increase</li>
  <li>Budding â€“ full grown plants develop buds which may become flowers</li>
  <li>Flowering â€“ the plant produces flowers and possibly fruit</li>
  <li>Ripening â€“ the plant is fully mature and the flowers/fruits become read</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nutrients">Nutrients</h2>
<p>There are 14 mineral nutrients which plants need to grow, which can be divided into two groups; macronutrients, and micronutrients. There are also three non-mineral nutrients which are required. Not all plants need all of the nutrients.</p>

<h3 id="non-mineral-nutrients">Non-Mineral Nutrients</h3>
<p>Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Carbon (C), are the three non-mineral nutrients needed for plant growth.
These nutrients form the chemical contents of the overwhelming majority of each plantâ€™s biomass.</p>

<h3 id="macronutrients">Macronutrients</h3>

<h3 id="micronutrients">Micronutrients</h3>

<p>Boron - seed and fruit development, and aids use of other nutrients</p>

<p>Copper - reproductive growth</p>

<p>Chlorine - aids metabolism</p>

<p>Iron - aids metabolism</p>

<p>Manganese - carbohydrate breakdown and nitrogen metabolism</p>

<p>Molybdenum - nitrogen use</p>

<p>Nickel - nitrogen use</p>

<p>Zinc - transformation of carbohydrates, sugar consumption regulation, and growth regulation</p>

<h3 id="fertilizer">Fertilizer</h3>
<p>Plant fertilizer is a collection of chemical compounds which together promote healthy plant growth.
Such collections of compounds should contain all of the nutrients a plant requires, and at the right relative concentrations for the plant they are supplied to.
The exact and optimal concentrations of each compound vary both between types of plant, and between the stages of the plantâ€™s lifecycle.</p>

<p>Plant fertilizer can be purchased based on a three-number combination describing its contents.
E.g. 24-8-16
The first number is the percentage of nitrogen \(\ce{N}\), the second is the percentage of phosphate \(\ce{P2O5}\), and the third is the percentage of potash \(\ce{K2O}\).</p>

<p>Fertizer grades describeâ€¦</p>

<p>Fertigation = adding nutrients to a crop using irrigation systems.</p>

<h4 id="miracle-gro-all-purpose">Miracle-Gro All Purpose</h4>
<p>The first fertilizer I purchased was Miracle-Gro All Purpose Water Soluble Plant Food, which is a 24-8-16 grade.
Nitrogen is provided as ammoniacal nitrogen (\(\ce{NH3-N}\), 3.5%) and ureic nitrogen (\(\ce{CO(NH2)2}\), 20.5%).
Phosphorous is provided as phosphorous pentoxide (\(\ce{P2O5}\), 8%).
Potassium is provided as potassium oxide (\(\ce{K2O}\), 16%).</p>

<h2 id="light">Light</h2>

<p>Most plants need light, as this is used by the <strong>chlorophyll</strong> in the plant to produce glucose in a process called <strong>photosynthesis</strong>.
This glucose is used by the plant to provide energy for growth.
The equation for the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to sugar and oxygen is as follows;</p>

\[\ce{6CO2 + 6H2O -&gt; C6H12O6 + 6O2}\]

<p>This means that using only the non-mineral nutrients described above, plants should be able to create glucose.
However, there are many other chemical processes going on so this is somewhat of a simplification.</p>

<p>Photoperiodism is the mechanism which plants use to stay in tune with seasons</p>

<h2 id="plant-reproduction">Plant Reproduction</h2>
<p>Plants (specifically spermatophytes aka seed-bearing plants) come from seeds, which are produced by existing plants at full maturity. 
The process of these seeds turning into a plant is called <strong>germination</strong>, and requires specific environmental conditions to be met.
A seed which has completed the germination process (and is now a baby plant), is called a seedling.</p>

<p>Not all seeds from a given sample will germinate over a given period.
This can be expressed as a percentage given a period, for example, a germination rate of 80% over 20 days means 80% of the seeds should germinate in specific conditions after 20 days.</p>

<p>Flowers contain the reproductive organs of plants. Thatâ€™s enough detail until we get to cultivating seeds.</p>

<p>Not all plants produce seeds, and some (like the humble Cavendish banana) are actually sterile.</p>

<p>Before germination can occur, a seed must be exposed to the correct environmental conditions, which is a process known as stratification.</p>

<p>Not all seeds germinate.
The viability of a seed depends on several factors, most obviously the physical condition of the seed, its previous exposure to extreme temperatures/pressures, and other parameters such as its age.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-propagation">Types of Propagation</h3>
<p>Plants donâ€™t always follow the stages outlined above. Instead, some of the stages can be skipped depending on how the plant is propagated. Here the term propagation refers to the creation of a new and independent plant from an existing plant.
The four types of propagation are;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seed propagation</li>
  <li>Vegetative propagation</li>
  <li>Rhizome propagation</li>
  <li>Tissue cultivation</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="seed-propagation">Seed Propagation</h4>

<p>Plants which produce seeds can be propagated by planting the seeds (!).</p>

<h4 id="vegetative-propagation">Vegetative Propagation</h4>

<p>Some plants can be successfully propagated by taking a cutting from an existing plant, and sowing it directly into a growth medium, nutrient solution, or just water.
While not all plants can be propagated this way, it is a low effort way to reproduce plants, and can be started early on in the plantâ€™s lifecycle.
This is useful as you donâ€™t have to wait for the plant to mature to the point of producing seeds.
In order to successfully propagate a plant using vegetative propagation, first check that the species can produce roots and shoots from cuttings, then take a cutting, and sow it.
Specific techniques vary between species.</p>

<h4 id="rhizome-propagation">Rhizome Propagation</h4>

<p>A <strong>rhizome</strong> is a type of underground plant stem which grows horizontally, and which is capable of producing both shoots and roots.
Not all plants grow rhizomes, but those which do use them to reproduce asexually.
When a rhizome grows and produces new shoots, these shoots can form new distinct plants, which are exact clones of the parent.
In practical terms, rhizome propagation is similar to vegetative propagation in that it involves identifying and preparing rhizome cuttings, and planting them directly into a growth medium.
Each rhizome cutting must have at least one node to grow.</p>

<h4 id="tissue-cultivation">Tissue Cultivation</h4>

<p>The most technically advanced way to propagate plants is a technique known as tissue cultivation.
Tissue cultivation involves taking a small sample from an existing plant, sowing it into a sterile, <strong>hormone-laced nutrient gel</strong>, and allowing it to grow from there.
Tissue cultures then gain mass as they utilise the nutrients, but will not look like a traditional plant.
Instead they will more closely resemble some kind of tumour.</p>

<p>In order to progress from a blob of plant tissue to a collection of usable seedlings, the mass can be placed in a nutrient containing a different hormone which will encourage sprouting.
After some time exposed to this hormone, many shoots will appear from the mass which can then be planted similar to vegetative propagation.
Each of the plants produced using this technique will be exact clones of the original plant.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-plant">Types of Plant</h2>

<h3 id="determinate-vs-indeterminate-growth">Determinate vs Indeterminate Growth</h3>
<p>Plants can either follow a set lifecycle, in which they germinate, grow, flower, and eventually die, or they can live indefinitely under the correct conditions.
Plants which follow a set lifecycle are said to be <strong>determinate</strong>.
Plants which can live indefinitely under the correct conditions are said to be <strong>indeterminate</strong>, or exhibit indeterminate growth.
Whether or not a plant is determinate or indeterminate depends on the genetic structure of the plant itself, rather than its environmental conditions.
One cannot make a plant of a determinate species live forever, and, given favourable and unchanging conditions, one cannot expect an indeterminate plant to stop growing.</p>

<h3 id="transgenic-plants">Transgenic Plants</h3>
<p>Plants into which one or more genes from another species have been introduced into the genome, are called transgenic plants.
The creation of these plants requires a genetic engineering process of some kind, of which there are several options.</p>

<h4 id="crispr">CRISPR</h4>
<p>Each living cell (in the Eukarya domain) contains a nucleus, which itself contains a molecule which describes how that cell should develop, function, grow, and reproduce.
This molecule is called <strong>DNA</strong>, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.
DNA is structured as two long strands of nucleotide bases (type of smaller molecule).
These strands wrap together based on these bases to form a large double-helix shaped molecule.
The four nucleotide bases in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guaning (G), and thymine (T).
These bases always exist as pairs along the strands of DNA, these â€˜base pairsâ€™ are A-T and C-G.</p>

<p>RNA is a molecule which can carry genetic information, and which has a number of purposesâ€¦
One purpose is to associate with enzymes and guide them to a location on another RNA (or DNA) molecule.
In CRISPR, a short sequence of nucleic acids called <strong>guide RNA</strong> (gRNA) helps guide enzymes to specific sections in DNA strands.
Using a word-search analogy, the gRNA is the word to find in a string of text - in this case the sequence to find in a string of DNA.</p>

<p><strong>Cas9</strong> is an enzyme which can cut apart DNA.
The Cas9 enzyme then cuts the DNA completely at the location the gRNA identified.
When the DNA in a cell is damaged, the cell will try to repair the break.
This repair can happen in two ways.
The first is <strong>nonhomologous</strong> (the ends join back together).
This usually results in gene disfunction, but is useful for finding what a gene does.
The second is <strong>homology directed repair</strong>, which uses a strand of nucleotide bases to guide cell repair.
They do this by having a middle part of a strand (the bit you want to add to the DNA), and â€˜homology armsâ€™ on each side, which exactly match the DNA sequences on either side of the cut.
This directs the cell to use the middle part as a guide when repairing its DNA, thereby inserting the patchâ€™s sequence into the cellâ€™s DNA.</p>

<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR).</p>

<p>Human DNA has 3 billion base pairs.</p>

<p>Chloroplasts have their own DNA.</p>

<p>The genotype of an organism is its complete genetic material.
The phenotype of an organism is its set of observable characteristics.</p>

<p>A segment of DNA which carries genetic information is called a gene.</p>

<p>When a cell is about to divide, DNA is condensed around histone proteins, which splits it into chromosomes.</p>

<p>A chromosome is a long DNA molecule which contains part or all of the genetic material of an organism.
Polyploids are organisms whose cells have more than one pair of chromosomes.</p>

<h2 id="plant-classification">Plant Classification</h2>
<p>The classification of plants, and by extension of all living creatures, is an ongoing and heavily debated area of science.
A simplification is currently done according to eight levels, with each encompassing a subset of the last.
This system is always evolving and changing as new species and relationships are discovered.
That said, we have to start somewhere, so the generally accepted system we use today contains the following levels;</p>

<p>\item Domain
\item Kingdom
\item Phylum
\item Class
\item Order
\item Family
\item Genus
\item Species</p>

<p>To keep these notes shorter than several libraries worth, weâ€™ll only look at the levels which relate to plants we may eventually grow, and even then will greatly simplify their taxonomy to save space.
To begin, we start with the domain of <strong>Eukarya</strong>, which contains all organisms whose cells have a nucleus.
From there, we are interested in the phylum of <strong>Plantae</strong>, which are organisms which obtain their energy from sunlight using chlorophyll.
Once we are talking about Plantae, things are still surprisingly broad.
In the business of hydroponics, we are likely going to be focussing on the class of Plantae called <strong>Angiosperms</strong>, which are commonly referred to as `flowering plantsâ€™.
These plants produce seeds, and contain over 300,000 species.
Of the Angiosperms, it then becomes a bit more specific, with things like carrots being classified as being in the order of Apiales (a group of molecularly similar plants), and tomatoes being classified as being in the order of Solaneles.</p>

<p>Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) is a</p>

<h3 id="visualising-classification-systems">Visualising Classification Systems</h3>
<p>The levels in a classification system can be represented as vertical measures on a dendrogram, or for a more interesting visual appearance a phylogenetic tree.
These trees are essentially radial dendrograms which show which species, shown on the outermost ring, are most closely related to oneanother, and where their genetic material diverges.</p>

<h3 id="bonsai-plants">Bonsai Plants</h3>
<p>Bonsai is the art of growing and training miniature trees. This isnâ€™t necessarily related to hydroponics, although it is possible to use hydroponics to create them. They are mentioned here as being loosely under the â€˜rare and exoticâ€™ remit in the introduction of these notes, but practically speaking the value of Bonsai plants comes from the work invested in their pruning/maintenance rather than their growth. For this reason, they wonâ€™t be discussed further.</p>
